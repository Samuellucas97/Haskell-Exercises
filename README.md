## Introduction

Theses repository contains my exercises to learn Haskell language programming. 


## About Haskell

Haskell is a computer programming language. In particular, it is a polymorphically statically typed, lazy, purely functional language, quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the lambda calculus, hence the lambda we use as a logo.

### Why use Haskell?

Writing large software systems that work is difficult and expensive. Maintaining those systems is even more difficult and expensive. Functional programming languages, such as Haskell, can make it easier and cheaper. Futhermore, Haskell offers you:

- Substantially increased programmer productivity (Ericsson measured an improvement factor of between 9 and 25 using Erlang, a functional programming language similar to Haskell, in one set of experiments on telephony software).
- Shorter, clearer, and more maintainable code.
- Fewer errors, higher reliability.
- A smaller "semantic gap" between the programmer and the language.
- Shorter lead times.
